        # Usage
        See examples.
        
        # Requirements
        Python 3.5.0/Anaconda 2.2.0

        After installing Anaconda you'll have to upgrade manually to Python 3.5. The latest version of Anaconda doesn't support python 3.5 yet, so for now create a virtual env and install the missing packages using `conda` or `pip3`.
        
        ```
        conda create -n py35 python=3.5
        ```
